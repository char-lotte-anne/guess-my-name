# 🔮 Madame Mystique's Crystal Ball

An interactive web application that uses a **custom-built hybrid AI system** (rule-based logic + machine learning) to predict names based on user responses to a series of questions. Built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS animations, and TensorFlow.js. **All AI/ML processing is done locally - no data is sent to ChatGPT, OpenAI, or any commercial AI services.**

🌐 **Live Website**: [https://guess-my-name-chi.vercel.app](https://guess-my-name-chi.vercel.app)

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: Engaging question-based interface with multiple question types (multiple choice, sliders, maps)
- **Custom Hybrid AI System**: Our own implementation combining rule-based decision trees with TensorFlow.js neural networks for accurate predictions. No commercial AI services (ChatGPT, OpenAI, etc.) are used - all processing happens locally or on GitHub.
- **Comprehensive Database**: 47,689+ names from Social Security Administration data (1880-2024)
- **State-Specific Predictions**: Uses geographic data from all 50 US states plus DC and territories
- **Inclusive Design**: Supports non-binary gender with gender-balanced name identification
- **Research-Based Algorithm**: Incorporates findings from NPR research, Namerology studies, and academic research on naming patterns
- **Privacy-First**: All data processing happens locally in the browser - no server-side data collection
- **Per-User Learning**: Machine learning model learns from each user's feedback (stored locally). Each user's model personalizes to their own data.
- **Beautiful UI**: Mystical-themed design with CSS animations and responsive layout

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/char-lotte-anne/guess-my-name.git
cd guess-my-name
```

2. Start a local web server:

**Option 1: Using Python**
```bash
cd src
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Option 2: Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)**
```bash
cd src
npx http-server -p 8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Direct File Access

You can also open `src/index.html` directly in your browser, though using a local server is recommended to avoid CORS issues.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The quiz asks questions about:
   - Gender identity
   - Birth decade
   - Birth state/location
   - Name length preferences
   - Vowel/consonant preferences
   - Popularity preferences
   - Political/cultural values
   - Language preferences
   - Religious/cultural background

2. **Hybrid Prediction System**:
   - **Rule-Based (70%)**: Decision tree filtering based on research-backed factors
   - **Machine Learning (30%)**: TensorFlow.js neural network for pattern recognition

3. **Scoring Algorithm**: Names are scored based on:
   - Political/cultural identity (strongest predictor per NPR research)
   - State of birth
   - Name length & structure
   - Popularity level
   - Gender identity
   - Cultural background

4. **Results**: Top 5 name predictions with confidence scores

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Advanced animations, responsive design, custom fonts
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla JS, no frameworks
- **TensorFlow.js**: Client-side machine learning (our custom implementation - no commercial AI services)
- **SVG**: Interactive maps for state/country selection

## 📊 Data Sources

- **Social Security Administration**: Baby name data (1880-2024)
- **NPR Research**: Political polarization in naming patterns
- **Namerology**: Rural vs urban naming trends
- **Academic Studies**: Socioeconomic determinants of naming choices

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

This application is completely privacy-focused:
- ✅ **Local storage first** - Quiz answers and optional names stored in browser's localStorage for local learning
- ✅ **No tracking or analytics** - This site doesn't track you or collect analytics
- ✅ **Local machine learning** - Our custom TensorFlow.js implementation trains on your device using locally stored data. The trained model exists only in memory during your session (not saved to disk). **No data is sent to ChatGPT, OpenAI, or any commercial AI services.**
- ✅ **You control your data** - Clear browser localStorage anytime to delete all stored data
- ✅ **Optional global learning** - Training data (quiz answers + success/failure + first names if voluntarily provided) may be sent to GitHub Issues for global model training. First names are included because they're the most valuable data for training. This data will be visible in public GitHub Issues. Only first names are sent (no last names, emails, or other identifying info).
- ✅ Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- ✅ All user inputs are validated and sanitized

**How Learning Works:**

1. **Local Learning (Primary)**: When you provide feedback (correct/wrong guesses or your real name), this data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. The machine learning model trains on this local data to personalize predictions for you. The model itself is not persisted - it only exists in memory during your session. All learning happens entirely on your device.

2. **Global Learning (Optional)**: When you provide feedback, training data (quiz answers + success/failure + your first name if you provide it) may be sent to GitHub Issues. This data is used to train a global model that improves predictions for all users. Your first name (if provided) is included because it's the most valuable data for training - it helps the model learn which names correspond to which characteristics. The global model is automatically downloaded from GitHub Releases. Note: This data will be visible in public GitHub Issues.

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- Only first names are sent (if you voluntarily provide them) - no last names, emails, or other identifying info
- Only quiz answers, feedback, and first names (if provided) are sent for global learning
- No IP addresses, device IDs, or tracking information
- You can use the app fully without providing your name or participating in global learning
- All data sent to GitHub Issues is public and auditable
- Providing your name is completely optional - the app works great without it
